  "Intro": "A group of college students pick a remote cemetery as a filming location for their short film ‘senior year’ project. What was meant to be a sad romantic love story turns into a horror film when the inaugural shooting date coincides with the Chinese Ghost Festival. The real terror happens when Ji (“Apittha” means “Klaiudom”), a mysterious girl who just joined the crew got possessed by a forlorn spirit. The evil spirit wants the crew to help it do something .. or they won’t be able to get out of the place forever.",
