  "Intro": "Prison Break là 1 serie phim truyền hình xuất sắc thuộc thể loại hình sự, bắt đầu được phát sóng tại Mỹ từ tháng 9 năm 2005, đến nay đã trải qua 4 seasons. Phần 1 với 22 tập và phần 4 vẫn đang chiếu. Phim chưa được phát sóng ở Việt Nam và cũng chưa được báo chí Việt Nam đưa tin mấy nên hầu như chúng ta vẫn chưa ai biết gì về nó . Thật đáng tiếc khi mà chúng ta vẫn đang phải đứng ngoài dòng chảy &#8220;Prison Break&#8221; trong khi cả thế giới đang lên cơn sốt với nó, độ hot không thua kém bất cứ 1 siêu phẩm phim nhựa nào của Hollywood đang được trình chiếu !!!",
