  "Intro": "A coming of age story set in the Vietnamese countryside during the late 1980s, as told through the eyes of a 12 year old boy named Thieu. Thieu and his younger brother Tuong share and do everything together. Their days unfold like a whimsical and comical journey filled with innocence, wonder, confusion and curious adventures. Tuong idolizes his older brother’s confidence and constantly strives for his approval. But in fact, Thieu’s “over-confidence” is to compensate for his overwhelming insecurities. Thieu is constantly jealous of his younger brother when it comes to grades, talent and affection from the girl next door, Moon. This leads to an act of violence which leaves Tuong paralyzed and bedridden. In coming to terms with his own conscience, Thieu attempts to redeem himself and discovers the true meaning of brotherhood.",
