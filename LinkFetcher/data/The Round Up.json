  "Intro": "1942. Joseph is eleven. And this June morning, he must go to school, a yellow star sown on his chest. He receives the support of a goods dealer. The mockery of a baker. Between kindness and contempt, Jo, his Jewish friends, their families, learn of life in an occupied Paris, on the Butte Montmartre, where they&#8217;ve taken shelter. At least that&#8217;s what they think, until that morning on July 16th 1942, when their fragile happiness is toppled over.",
