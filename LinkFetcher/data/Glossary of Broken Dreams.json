Everyone is talking about freedom! Privacy! Identity! Resistance! The Market! The Left! But, yikes, Johannes can&#8217;t tolerate ignorant and topically abusive comments on the &#8220;Internet&#8221; anymore! Supported by writer Ishan Raval, in this film, Johannes explains, re-evaluates, and sometimes sacrifices political golden calves of discourse.Not to be used with false consciousness or silicone-based lubricant.",
