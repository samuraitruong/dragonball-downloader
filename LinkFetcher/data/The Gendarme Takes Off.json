  "Intro": "The whole clique of Cruchot&#8217;s police station is retired. Now he lives with his rich wife in her castle &#8211; and is bored almost to death. He fights with the butler, because he isn&#8217;t even allowed to do the simple works. But when one of the clique suffers from amnesia after an accident, all of the others reunite and kidnap him, to take him on a tour to their old working places and through their memories. In their old uniforms they turn St. Tropez upside down.",
