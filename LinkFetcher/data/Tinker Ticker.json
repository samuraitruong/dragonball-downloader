  "Intro": "Jung-gu sends out homemade bombs to people who are likely to use them. He partners up with Hyo-min, the first person to actually detonate one of them. However, Hyo-min becomes reckless and stirs up Jung-gu&#8217;s aggressive tendencies that he has tried hard to suppress. Finally, Jung-gu explodes in anger, killing the detective on his tail and framing Hyo-min for all his crimes.",
