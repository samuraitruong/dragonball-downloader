  "Intro": "THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY is inspired by the existentialist novel of the same name by G.K. Chesterton (1908). The novel is considered a metaphysical thriller, and our film could be considered the same, though it also can be thought of in more classical cinematic terms a psychological and supernatural thriller.",
