  "Intro": "Based on Molière&#8217;s play. The children of Harpagon, Cléante and his sister Elise, are each in love but they still haven&#8217;t spoken to their father yet. Harpagon is a miser who wants to choose the right man and the right woman for his children. When Cléante, at last, tries to speak to Harpagon, the old man informs the family that he wants to marry Marianne, the young girl loved by Cléante. Unaware of his son&#8217;s sorrow, Harpagon doesn&#8217;t understand why Cléante has become so angry with him.",
