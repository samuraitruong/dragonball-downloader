  "Intro": "Manchester, the present. Michael divides his time between the job center and the pub. A chance meeting with Lee, an introduction to her Uncle Ian and a heavy night on the lash lead to a job working the door at a Northern Quarter massage parlor. After witnessing the violent death of one of the punters, Michael experiences blood-drenched flashbacks and feels himself being sucked into a twilight world that he doesn&#8217;t understand but that is irresistibly attractive. When he eventually finds out what goes on in the room below Cloud 9, Michaels&#8217; life will never be the same again.",
