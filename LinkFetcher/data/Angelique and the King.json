  "Intro": "Soon after her latest husband death, the King himself (Louis XIV) meets with our heroine and begs her to help convince the Persian Ambassador to agree to a treaty. However, what they didn&#8217;t realize was that the handsome Persian was in fact a sexual sadist. So, it is up to the King&#8217;s half- brother, some Hungarian prince, to save Angélique from the evil troll&#8217;s clutches.",
