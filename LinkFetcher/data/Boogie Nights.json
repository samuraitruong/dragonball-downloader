  "Intro": "Set in 1977, back when sex was safe, pleasure was a business and business was booming, idealistic porn producer Jack Horner aspires to elevate his craft to an art form. Horner discovers Eddie Adams, a hot young talent working as a busboy in a nightclub, and welcomes him into the extended family of movie-makers, misfits and hangers-on that are always around. Adams&#8217; rise from nobody to a celebrity adult entertainer is meteoric, and soon the whole world seems to know his porn alter ego, &#8220;Dirk Diggler&#8221;. Now, when disco and drugs are in vogue, fashion is in flux and the party never seems to stop, Adams&#8217; dreams of turning sex into stardom are about to collide with cold, hard reality.",
