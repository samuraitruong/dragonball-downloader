  "Intro": "Not long after John Chambers and his family arrive at their new home in a small country town of Pennsylvania, John begins to experience sleep paralysis. Lying there paralyzed, trapped within his own nightmare, other-worldly beings visit John. They are entities which exist in the darkest shadows of the night and can only be seen out of the corner of one&#8217;s eye. These encounters begin to haunt John, transforming to complete terror as he discovers the entities&#8217; sole purpose&#8230; the abduction of his seven year old son. In the end, John will uncover the town&#8217;s horrific secret, a portal on his land, and make one last attempt to save his son before the shadow people permanently take him away to their world.",
