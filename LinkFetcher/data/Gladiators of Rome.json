Is this the beginning of a new legend? The legend of a great hero? Not so much! Timo is not exactly gladiator material! He just wants to hang out with his friends, Ciccius and Mauritius, and avoid his stepfather&#8217;s bizarre training sessions at all costs! However, when Timo meets the lovely Lucilla, he decides to change his life and bring out the valour inside himself &#8211; valour that has never shown itself before. Through spells, crazy raids in the woods and terrible trainings of a very personal lady trainer, Timo has to transform himself into the greatest gladiator of all time. And as they say, if &#8220;fortune favours the bold&#8221; in Rome &#8230; hard times are awaiting Timo!",
