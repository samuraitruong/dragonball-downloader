  "Intro": "Self condemned to the immense and boundless prison of the Mojave desert, Phoenix leads a life of forced isolation, living by himself in a house as far away as possible from the rest of the world. Phoenix does one thing and one thing only: he digs holes. Every month he digs a hole in the middle of nowhere and buries something. The last stronghold of society stands with the man that frequently delivers his mail. When one day the delivery doesn&#8217;t happen by the hand of his trustworthy mailman, but by that of the beautiful and quizzical Ariel, Phoenix&#8217;s life derails in an escalation that leads him to dangerous consequences which will be impossible to escape.",
