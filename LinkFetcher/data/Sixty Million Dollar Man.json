  "Intro": "Stephen Chow plays a rich playboy who is blown up by a mafia boss when he flirts with the boss&#8217;s girl. Through a series of circumstances his professor makes him a synthetic (robotic) body that allows him to change into a variety of &#8220;Mrs. Wong&#8217;s Household products&#8221; like a microwave and toothpaste. Chow eventually goes to work at a school notorious for it&#8217;s rowdy students and singlehandledly disciplines them all. He then goes on to marry a former classmate played by Gigi Leung. But before the wedding happens, the mafia boss finds out that Chow is still alive and sends in his own human-robot to take Chow out for once and for all.",
