  "Intro": "Dae-su, once a promising taekwondo athlete with &#8216;incompetent swing kick&#8217; and Mira, who dreamt of becoming an idol, unexpectedly became teenage parents at the age of 17. Now they&#8217;re 33 and have a 16-year old son Ahreum. Due to an extremely rare genetic disorder called progeria, Ahreum ages exponentially faster than normal people. Even though he&#8217;s just a teenager, his body is that of an 80-year old man&#8217;s. Despite all the negativity and hardships in their lives, this tight-knit young family carries on, taking one day at a time. One day, Ahreum&#8217;s story is broadcasted nationally via network TV program. He is suddenly thrown into the spotlight, and his normally dull days are now filled with moments of happiness, joy and sorrow?",
