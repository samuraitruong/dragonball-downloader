  "Intro": "This work is directed by Yolikojun&#8217;s original script. Misaki Morino challenged the role of a new landscape of the main character A child and each personality derived from inside of himself, three roles with different character. A human pattern that comes into view as complicated and tricky drama, mainly A child, develops. And sex and life, or death beyond that.",
