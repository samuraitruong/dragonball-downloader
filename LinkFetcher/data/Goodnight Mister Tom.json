  "Intro": "We&#8217;re in an English village shortly before Dunkirk. &#8220;Mr. Tom&#8221; Oakley still broods over the death of his wife and small son while he was away in the navy during WWI, and grief has made him a surly hermit. Now children evacuated from London are overwhelming volunteers to house them. Practically under protest, Mr. Tom takes in a painfully quiet 10-year-old, who gradually reveals big problems. William",
