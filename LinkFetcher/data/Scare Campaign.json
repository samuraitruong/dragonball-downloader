  "Intro": "Popular prank TV show, Scare Campaign, has been entertaining audiences for the last 5 years with its mix of old school scares and hidden camera fun. But as we enter a new age of online TV the producers find themselves up against a new hard edged web series which makes their show look decidedly quaint. It&#8217;s time to up the ante, but will the team go too far this time, and are they about to prank the wrong guy?",
